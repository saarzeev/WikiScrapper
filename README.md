Patterns we are supporting in:

Awards patterns-
We will try to collect the information from the tables in the page of the actor
If we didn't find the information there we will look in the following link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_firstname_lastnme where firstname and last name varies with the actor name
we will count from the tables the occurrences of won,honored,honoured and sum them to number of awards won by the actor
